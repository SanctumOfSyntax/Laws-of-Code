# The Ten Immutable Laws of Code

1. **Thou Shalt Code with Clarity**  
   For clarity is the window to the soul of code; write not for machines alone, but for humans who seek to understand thy intent.

2. **Thou Shalt Embrace the Discipline of Testing**  
   Let no line of code go forth without trial, for untested code is the harbinger of downfall.

3. **Thou Shalt Honor the Principle of Simplicity**  
   Seek simplicity, for it is the ultimate sophistication. Complexity is a beast that shall ensnare both creator and user.

4. **Thou Shalt Not Repeat Thyself**  
   In repetition, there is waste; refactor with diligence, so that each piece of logic lives but once, yet is invoked many times.

5. **Thou Shalt Hold Sacred the Sanctity of Data**  
   Treat data as the precious commodity it is; guard it, validate it, and never trust its origin without scrutiny.

6. **Thou Shalt Not Covet Inefficiency**  
   Shun the paths that lead to resource wastage, for efficiency in code is a reflection of the divine.

7. **Thou Shalt Keep Abreast of the Changing Times**  
   Technology is an ever-flowing river; paddle its currents or be left adrift.

8. **Thou Shalt Write Code as if the Most Malevolent of Bugs is Lurking Within It**  
   Assume thy code is flawed and seek these imperfections actively, lest they emerge in the hour of greatest need.

9. **Thou Shalt Not Ignore the Needs of the End User**  
   For the end user is thy patron; heed their needs and thou shalt craft software that endures.

10. **Thou Shalt Reverently Use Thy Power for Good**  
   With great power comes great responsibility; code with ethics, for what is built with disregard may become thy downfall.
